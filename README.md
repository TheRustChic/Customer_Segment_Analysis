 📈 Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on the Mall Customers dataset from Kaggle. It identifies customer groups based on spending habits and income levels to support targeted marketing strategies.

📁 Tools Used:
Python (JupyterLab)

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

📊 Dataset:
Source: Kaggle – Mall Customer Segmentation Data

Features:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

🔍 Project Highlights:
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for clustering

Used K-Means algorithm to identify optimal customer segments (4 clusters)

Renamed cluster groups based on spending/income behavior:

High Spenders

Young Spenders

Low Spenders

Mid-Income Cautious

Visualized clusters using 2D scatter plots:

Annual Income vs Spending Score

Age vs Spending Score

3D visualization of Income, Age, and Score

📌 Skills Demonstrated:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

K-Means clustering & elbow method

Grouping and summarizing clusters with groupby()

Visualization of high-dimensional data

Interpreting unsupervised learning results
